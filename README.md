## Scope

Note we generally need screens for both desktop and mobile. If we scope in japanese i18n, we also need screens for desktop / mobile X japanese / english, in case layouts shift. Also note we generally need really high levels of accessibility, as our demographics are older. We really need to focus on the large text + mobile experience.

### Phase 1

Home page

* Hero section
* 1-3 important sections that people need all the time
  * Next church date
  * Next event date
  * ???

Common elements

* Navbar
* Footer
* Colors
* Font
* Logos

Calendar / Upcoming events

* Google calendar <-> events page synchronization
* Update content within a google calendar -> update content on the site
  * Title
  * Description
  * Date / time
  * Attachments on google drive (?) -> to explore
* Differentiate between different gcals for different committees/types of events?

Contact Us

* Form that shoots an email / updates some monitored inbox
  * Name
  * Email
  * Phone number
  * What to ask?

About us:

* easy page with rich text content

### Phase 2

Media corner

* iframe embed of Youtube playlist
* iframe embed of google photos?
* Big idea -- keep Youtube playlist updated, keep google photos updated, and the site will also be updated.

Get involved

* IDK what to do with this page
* I suggest a plaintext area that has content for all of our recurring events
* Some churches have a bunch of nested pages for everything they do. I think this scales poorly and makes for a bad experience

Virtual giving page

* Hyperlink to the presbytery

### Phase 3

Japanese internationalization

* A button that allows for the website to be rendered in japanese

Pasters corner / weekly blog / newsletter

* Some way to sync a rich text source -> blog format
* Could outsource to 3rd party (e.g. substack) and just hyperlink
* Could look into iframe solutions

Church member feature

* Just for fun. pictures of members w short bio
